## Current Session State, Goals, and Progress

*This file tracks the current development session and is automatically updated by the memory-bank-synchronizer agent to maintain session continuity.*

### Current Session Overview

**Session Started:** Current Integration Phase
**Primary Goal:** Integrate memory-bank-synchronizer agent into all knowledge management workflows
**Session Type:** System Enhancement - Memory Management Integration

### Active Development Focus

**Current Phase:** Memory Bank System Integration
**Active Feature:** Knowledge Management Enhancement
**Execution Status:** In Progress

### Session Progress Tracking

#### Completed Tasks
- [x] Analysis of current project structure and memory system
- [x] Examination of existing knowledge storage patterns  
- [x] Review of memory-bank-synchronizer agent capabilities
- [x] Creation of integration plan
- [x] Creation of CLAUDE-patterns.md foundation file
- [x] Creation of CLAUDE-decisions.md foundation file
- [x] Creation of CLAUDE-activeContext.md (this file)

#### Current Task Status
- [o] Creating Memory Bank Foundation files
  - [x] CLAUDE-patterns.md
  - [x] CLAUDE-decisions.md  
  - [x] CLAUDE-activeContext.md
  - [ ] CLAUDE-troubleshooting.md (if needed)
  - [ ] CLAUDE-config-variables.md (if needed)

#### Pending Tasks
- [ ] Update create-prd.md to integrate memory-bank-synchronizer
- [ ] Update generate-tasks.md to integrate memory-bank-synchronizer
- [ ] Update create-agent.md to integrate memory-bank-synchronizer
- [ ] Update process-task-list.md to integrate memory-bank-synchronizer
- [ ] Enhance settings.json with new hooks
- [ ] Update organize-agent-summary.sh script
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with new integration points

### Key Context for Session Continuity

#### Integration Strategy
- **Proactive Synchronization:** Memory-bank-synchronizer validates and updates documentation
- **Hook Integration:** Automatic triggers at key workflow points
- **Pattern Validation:** Ensure documented patterns match implementation
- **Knowledge Accuracy:** Eliminate outdated or incorrect information

#### Files Being Modified
- All workflow management files (create-prd.md, generate-tasks.md, create-agent.md, process-task-list.md)
- Configuration files (.claude/settings.json)
- Helper scripts (scripts/organize-agent-summary.sh)
- Project documentation (CLAUDE.md)

#### System State Changes
- Adding memory bank foundation files (CLAUDE-*.md)
- Integrating memory-bank-synchronizer into workflow decision points
- Enhancing hooks for automatic knowledge validation
- Transforming passive to active knowledge management

### Next Session Preparation

**When Resuming Work:**
1. Review current task status in this file
2. Check for any code changes that may have occurred
3. Validate memory bank synchronization needs
4. Continue with pending tasks in order

**Context Handoff:**
- Memory bank foundation established
- Integration plan approved and in progress
- Core workflow files ready for enhancement
- Hook system prepared for memory-bank-synchronizer integration

### Notes and Decisions

#### Session Decisions
- Memory bank files follow single-responsibility principle
- Integration happens at natural workflow transition points
- Hooks provide automatic synchronization without manual intervention
- Existing workflow patterns preserved while adding synchronization

#### Technical Considerations
- Memory-bank-synchronizer called proactively, not just reactively
- Pattern validation happens before and after major workflow steps
- Cross-session consistency maintained through active context tracking
- Knowledge accuracy prioritized over completeness
