## Architecture Decisions and Rationale

*This file is automatically maintained by the memory-bank-synchronizer agent to ensure decisions documented here reflect current implementation reality and outcomes.*

### Core System Decisions

#### ADR-001: 5-Phase AI-Assisted Development Workflow
**Date:** Initial System Design
**Status:** Implemented
**Last Reviewed:** Initial Setup

**Context:**
Need for structured approach to AI-assisted product development that breaks down complex features into manageable, trackable phases.

**Decision:**
Implement 5-phase workflow: PRD Creation → Task Generation → Agent Creation → Task Processing → Knowledge Capture

**Rationale:**
- Separates planning from execution for better quality
- Creates reusable patterns and specialized agents
- Enables parallel execution of independent tasks
- Automatic knowledge capture prevents information loss
- Scales from simple features to complex systems

**Consequences:**
- Positive: Clear workflow structure, reusable agents, automatic documentation
- Negative: Additional overhead for simple tasks
- Mitigation: Process can be abbreviated for trivial features

#### ADR-002: Memory Bank System Architecture
**Date:** Initial System Design
**Status:** Implementing
**Last Reviewed:** Current

**Context:**
Need for persistent, accurate project knowledge that stays synchronized with evolving codebase.

**Decision:**
Implement active memory bank system with memory-bank-synchronizer agent as central coordinator.

**Rationale:**
- Passive documentation becomes outdated quickly
- Active synchronization ensures accuracy
- Specialized agent can validate patterns against implementation
- Cross-reference validation maintains consistency

**Consequences:**
- Positive: Always-current documentation, pattern validation, decision tracking
- Negative: Additional complexity in workflow integration
- Mitigation: Automatic integration through hooks minimizes manual overhead

#### ADR-003: Hook-Based Automatic Documentation
**Date:** Initial System Design  
**Status:** Implemented
**Last Reviewed:** Initial Setup

**Context:**
Manual documentation creation is inconsistent and often skipped under time pressure.

**Decision:**
Use Claude Code hooks to automatically capture knowledge at completion points.

**Rationale:**
- SubagentStop hooks trigger at natural completion boundaries
- `/compact` command provides high-quality conversation summaries
- Timestamped storage creates audit trail
- Organization scripts structure knowledge for retrieval

**Consequences:**
- Positive: Zero-effort documentation, consistent capture, searchable knowledge base
- Negative: Hook configuration complexity, dependency on Claude Code features
- Mitigation: Graceful fallback if hooks unavailable

#### ADR-004: Color-Coded Agent System
**Date:** Agent Creation Implementation
**Status:** Implemented
**Last Reviewed:** Initial Setup

**Context:**
Parallel agent execution requires clear visual coordination and role identification.

**Decision:**
Assign distinct colors to agent types: UI (Blue), API (Green), Database (Purple), Testing (Orange), DevOps (Red), General (Gray).

**Rationale:**
- Visual identification enables quick role recognition
- Conflict detection easier with color coordination  
- Status monitoring across parallel agents
- Consistent agent type categorization

**Consequences:**
- Positive: Clear agent coordination, reduced confusion, better parallel execution
- Negative: Additional metadata to maintain
- Mitigation: Automatic color assignment based on task domain analysis

### Technical Implementation Decisions

#### ADR-005: Task Status Progression System
**Date:** Task Processing Design
**Status:** Implemented
**Last Reviewed:** Initial Setup

**Decision:**
Use three-state progression: `[ ]` (pending) → `[o]` (in progress) → `[x]` (completed)

**Rationale:**
- Clear visual progress indication
- Prevents multiple agents working same task
- Supports both sequential and parallel execution patterns
- Simple enough for reliable automation

#### ADR-006: Synchronized Testing and Commits
**Date:** Parallel Execution Design
**Status:** Implemented
**Last Reviewed:** Initial Setup

**Decision:**
Test and commit at execution group level, not individual task level.

**Rationale:**
- Reduces commit noise from parallel development
- Ensures all parallel changes tested together
- Maintains atomicity of related changes
- Simplifies rollback if issues arise

**Consequences:**
- Positive: Cleaner git history, atomic features, comprehensive testing
- Negative: Longer time between commits, potential for larger rollbacks
- Mitigation: Careful dependency analysis to minimize risk

### Operational Decisions

#### ADR-007: Memory Bank File Structure
**Date:** Knowledge System Design
**Status:** Implementing
**Last Reviewed:** Current

**Decision:**
Separate memory bank files by concern: patterns, decisions, active context, troubleshooting, config variables.

**Rationale:**
- Single responsibility principle for documentation
- Easier to maintain and update specific aspects
- Reduces cognitive load when referencing specific information
- Enables targeted synchronization by memory-bank-synchronizer

#### ADR-008: Knowledge Base Organization
**Date:** Knowledge Capture Design
**Status:** Implemented
**Last Reviewed:** Initial Setup

**Decision:**
Two-tier organization: raw timestamped files → organized by feature and agent type.

**Rationale:**
- Raw files preserve complete context and audit trail
- Organized structure enables efficient retrieval
- Feature-based organization matches development workflow
- Agent-type categorization reveals patterns across similar tasks
